"""What happened to everybody else in this game, before you install.

The tool decides a route from the executable alone: what it imports, what
ships beside it, how the engine behaves. That is a good guess about one
machine. It is not what a thousand machines actually found - and the answer
to "will this work in Red Dead Redemption 2" has been sitting in the issue
tracker the whole time, in somebody's head, instead of in the tool.

How it works, with no server anywhere:

* People press "it worked" / "it did not" after playing. That opens a
  GitHub issue - the same way the bug report does - carrying one machine
  readable block and nothing that identifies them: the game's name and
  executable, the route, the build, the graphics API, the card's model and
  architecture, the driver, this tool's version, the outcome, and - where
  the session was measured - the work area it ran at, the milliseconds a frame
  spent on what grows with that area, and the frame rate. No paths, no user name,
  no machine id, and nothing at all leaves without the button being pressed.
* A workflow in the repository adds those up into `docs/compatibility.json`.
* Every tool downloads that file and reads it before an install.

So the write side is a browser window the person can read and cancel, and
the read side is one static file. Nothing here phones home.
