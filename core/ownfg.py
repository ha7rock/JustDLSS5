r"""Frame generation files the person downloaded themselves (#370).

Two community projects give RTX 20/30 cards frame generation on top of the
OptiScaler route, and neither can be fetched by this tool:

  * sdli1995/dlssg_for_sm86 - a version.dll proxy plus dlssg_sm86.ini beside
    the game's executable. Its releases carry no files and no licence, and
    the dll embeds NVIDIA's nvngx_dlssg.dll.
  * DLSS Enabler (Nexus mod 757) - its version.dll, renamed
    dlss-enabler-headless.dll, in the folder OptiScaler is in.

So the person picks the files they downloaded, and the tool does the part
that goes wrong by hand: the right name in the right place, a backup of
anything it replaces, a record in the install manifest, and all of it out
again on uninstall. The picked files are copied into the tool's own folder
(%LOCALAPPDATA%\dlss5-autopilot\own-fg) so "update all" can place them
again after the download folder has been cleaned.

Nothing here runs the files. They are identified by name and by strings in
their bytes, and a dll must be a 64-bit Windows binary.

Not tried on this project's own rig (an RTX 40, which has frame generation
of its own); SiTWulf ran the sm86 files on an RTX 3060 with this tool's
OptiScaler install. Labelled experimental everywhere it shows.
