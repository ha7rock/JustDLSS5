r"""Multi-frame generation on RTX 40: dashdogy's RTX40MFG-Unlock.

NVIDIA sells DLSS Multi Frame Generation (3x/4x, up to 6x) as an RTX 50
feature; RTX 40 gets plain 2x frame generation. dashdogy's unlock hooks the
Streamline and NGX calls inside the game before the frame-generation
feature is created, validates the adapter and the wrapper, and asks for the
higher multiplier with the Ada temporal correction applied. Nothing on disk
is changed - NVIDIA's own files are left alone, the change lives in memory.

It needs three things, all of which this module handles:

  - the game already has working DLSS Frame Generation (Streamline). The
    unlock adds multipliers to a feature the game has; it does not add
    frame generation to a game without it.
  - Ultimate ASI Loader (ThirteenAG) under a proxy name the game imports
    early, so RTX40MFG.asi runs before the first frame-generation pipeline
    exists. ReShade holds dxgi.dll, so the loader goes in as dinput8.dll
    or version.dll - whichever the executable imports. An executable that
    imports none of the loader's names cannot take it, and the tool says
    so instead of guessing.
  - a ReShade with add-on support, for the DLSS MFG tab where the
    multiplier is chosen. Every ReShade route here has that.

Research software, in its author's words: higher multipliers and Vulkan may
give artifacts, a frozen picture or a crash. Off by default, RTX 40 only,
and only offered when the game itself ships a DLSS Frame Generation runtime.
