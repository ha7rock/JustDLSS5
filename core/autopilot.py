r"""Install, watch the game start, and try the next route when nothing loaded.

The tool has always stopped at the same place: it writes the files, says
what it wrote, and the person is on their own from there. Two classes of
report come straight out of that gap - "the install stopped part way" and
"nothing we wrote ever loaded" are 32 of the 87 reports in the corpus - and
both were answerable at the time, by the machine, in about a minute.

This is that minute. One pass is:

    install the route -> start the game (or ask, when this tool may not) ->
    wait for the process and let it settle -> read its module list

and the module list decides. Our dxgi.dll in the process means the chain is
in and the person can play; our dxgi.dll beside the game while System32's is
the one loaded means this route cannot work here, however many times it is
installed - so the next route is tried without anybody having to know that.

What it deliberately does NOT do:

  * decide whether the picture is better. That needs frames, a log and
    somebody looking at the screen; "did it work?" answers it afterwards.
  * start a game with anti-cheat, or a launcher executable. The first can
    read a started process as tampering, the second starts the wrong thing.
  * keep going forever. Three routes, then it stops and says so - a loop
    that reinstalls all night is not autopilot, it is a fault.

Nothing here writes into a game folder: the installs are `installer.install`
as the window runs it, and the watching is `watch`, which only reads.
