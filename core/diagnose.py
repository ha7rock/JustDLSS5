"""Reading the logs back and saying, in plain words, what happened.

Installing is the easy half. The hard half is that DLSS quietly fails to start
in a lot of games and all the user sees is "nothing changed". The add-ons
write detailed logs; this turns them into an answer.

Which log matters depends on the route:

    feeder   dlss5-feed.log next to the game, plus host64/dlss5-feed-host.log
             on the 32-bit path where the real NGX work happens
    bridge   dlss5-bridge writes into ReShade.log
    native   nothing but ReShade.log - the add-on hooks the game's own calls
    upstream the same: neural-upstream shows its state in its overlay tab
    standalone LOCALAPPDATA/RHI/Logs/standalone-dlssnr.log - outside the game
             folder, and ONE file for every game the add-on ever ran in, so
             only its last session is read
    remix    rtx-remix/logs/remix-dxvk.log - the Remix runtime's own log. No
             ReShade is involved at all on that route, so ReShade.log and the
             feed log say nothing about it.

A log older than the install is from a previous setup and is ignored rather
than reported as if it described the current one.

When there is no log at all, the folder itself is the evidence: a proxy DLL
that has vanished says "antivirus", an untouched folder says "not started
yet". "Not run yet, or ReShade never loaded" told nobody anything, and a real
bug report arrived carrying exactly that and nothing else.
