"""Self-update check.

Asks GitHub whether a newer release of this tool exists. It never replaces
itself silently - a running .exe cannot be overwritten safely, and quietly
swapping a binary is exactly the behaviour you should not trust from a tool
like this. The user gets a notice and a button that opens the release page.

The check is a single request, runs in the background, and failing is not an
error: no internet simply means no notice.
