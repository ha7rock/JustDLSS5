"""Aim for a frame rate, instead of guessing at a percentage.

Neural rendering has one dial that costs frames: the resolution the model
runs at. Everyone sets it by feel - drop it to 75%, play, decide it is
still heavy, drop it again. The measurements to do better were already
being written down by the add-ons and thrown away:

* the feeder logs "N frames: feed CPU X ms/frame ... Y fps" - the frame
  rate the person actually had;
* the OptiScaler forks log "DLSS-NR cost: 7.41 ms total = 7.23 ms model"
  every frame the model draws - the cost of the dial itself.

So: play, quit, and the tool reads what the session really cost and works
out the resolution that meets your target for the next one.

The maths, because a number that appears from nowhere is not trustworthy.
The model runs over an area, and area goes with the square of the
resolution, so the frame time splits into a part the dial does not touch
and a part that scales:

    frame_ms(r) = base + k * r^2

With two sessions at two different resolutions that is two equations and
two unknowns, so `base` and `k` are solved exactly, and the answer for a
target T is r = sqrt((1000/T - base) / k). With only one session there is
nothing to solve - one point does not fix a line - so the first suggestion
is a bounded step in the right direction, and the tool says as much rather
than dressing a guess up as a calculation.

Nothing here changes anything during a game: OptiScaler reads its ini once,
at startup (Config::Reload is called from load, and nothing watches the
file), and the feeder reads its cfg the same way. Between sessions is what
this can honestly do, and it is what it does.
