"""One game: its routes, its settings, and everything done to it.

Logic only - gamepage and setpanel draw it. Ported from the 1.9 window's
install page with every rule kept (route visibility, the install-options
contract, the crash overrides, the autotune order, share consent), and three
of its bugs fixed on the way:

* settings live in `self.settings`, not in widgets, so nothing drifts
  between what the page shows and what the install does;
* a setting whose row is not shown for the route never reaches Options -
  the 1.9 window sent the feeder's preset and HDR to OptiScaler too;
* nvngx_dlss has an "auto" choice, so an untouched page no longer pins the
  first build the catalog happened to list.

The game's detection (dlss.detect, anti-cheat, manifests) runs on a worker
when the page opens; the 1.9 window did it on the Tk thread on every pick.
