r"""Are the parts installed in a game still the current ones?

A fresh install always fetches the newest of everything, so the day you set a
game up it is current. Nothing told you afterwards. ReShade, renodx, the
neural-rendering runtime and OptiScaler all move, and someone whose game was
set up a month ago had no way to know they were a version behind short of
reinstalling and reading the log.

This compares the versions recorded in a game's manifest against what the
sources offer now. It only reports - the fix is to install again, which
already pulls the newest of everything.
