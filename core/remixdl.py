r"""Fetching an RTX Remix mod from its own GitHub release and putting it in.

The tool has always linked to these mods and left the download to the person.
That is still right for most of them - a Remix project is somebody else's
work, often gigabytes, with its own instructions - but for the ones published
as a plain .zip on the author's own GitHub releases there is nothing a person
does that this cannot do exactly: fetch the file the author published, and
copy it into the game folder.

The layout is the hard part, and it is not the same twice:

    GTA IV      everything sits under GTAIV-Remix-CompatibilityMod/ inside
                the zip, so extracting the zip as-is would bury the mod one
                folder deep and it would never load
    NFSU2       .trex/ and rtx.conf are at the zip root already
    Deus Ex     the release is a renderer plus dev tools, not a Remix drop-in
    Garry's Mod needs its own launcher and the game in a fixed-function mode
    Saints Row 3  the zip is configuration only, no runtime in it

So nothing is extracted blind. `remix_root()` looks for the directory inside
the archive that IS the Remix install - a `.trex` beside a runtime DLL and a
`rtx.conf`/`dxvk.conf` - and only that directory's contents go into the game
folder. An archive with no such directory is refused and the person is sent
to the mod's own page, which is what happened before this module existed.

Verified against the real thing: the rule picks
`GTAIV-Remix-CompatibilityMod` out of the 524 MB GTA IV zip and lands exactly
the file set (`.trex`, `d3d9.dll`, `dinput8.dll`, `dxvk.conf`, the .asi and
the launch .bat files) that a hand-installed copy of that mod has.
