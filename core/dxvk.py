r"""DXVK - run a D3D10/D3D11 game on Vulkan so ReShade can stay out of it.

Some games watch their own process and quit, without a word, the moment a
ReShade proxy DLL hooks Direct3D. Metal Gear Solid V is the known case: with
ReShade as dxgi.dll or d3d11.dll the game creates its D3D11 device, never
gets as far as a swap chain, and exits cleanly about a second later. No crash,
no dialog, no log line. It does not matter which add-ons are loaded - a bare
ReShade does it too.

DXVK sidesteps that. It replaces dxgi.dll and d3d11.dll with a translation
layer that renders through Vulkan, and ReShade then reaches the game as a
Vulkan layer - a registry entry the Vulkan loader reads, nothing hooked inside
the game. The chain becomes:

    game (D3D11) -> dxgi.dll + d3d11.dll (DXVK, translates to Vulkan)
                 -> ReShade Vulkan layer -> add-ons, exactly as on a Vulkan game

The feeder's Vulkan transport then runs DLSS on a private D3D12 device and
shares the frame across the API boundary. Verified on MGS V (RTX 4060 Ti,
DXVK 3.1, DLSS5-Feeder 0.7.0): the DLAA feature builds and frames flow.

DXVK is MIT-licensed; releases are at github.com/doitsujin/dxvk.
