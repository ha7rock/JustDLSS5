r"""The OptiScaler route: DLSS 5 neural rendering without ReShade at all.

Dagherbou's OptiScaler fork runs the neural-rendering model as an extra pass
over OptiScaler's upscaler output. What makes it interesting is where the
inputs come from: rather than synthesising depth and motion vectors, it reads
the ones the game already hands to DLSS every frame.

    feeder      game -> ReShade -> depth copy + motion-vector shader ->
                synthetic contract -> DLSS. Always DLAA, and the shader work
                is real per-frame cost.
    optiscaler  game -> OptiScaler (proxy DLL) -> the game's own DLSS inputs
                -> NR pass. Real upscaling, so a lower render resolution
                genuinely costs less to draw.

Read FPS comparisons between the two carefully: at 75% resolution OptiScaler
is drawing fewer pixels while the feeder is always at native, so part of any
gap is upscaling rather than efficiency.

REQUIREMENTS the author states:
  - RTX 50 series in the author's own testing. They note builds compiled for
    older cards exist but have not tested them - the SF/RTX40 nvngx_dlssnr
    builds this tool picks carry sm_75/86/89, and RTX 40 is confirmed working
    in the field (KCD2 on a 4060 Ti), so older cards are on: the dial is what
    makes the pass affordable there.
  - a driver shipping nvngx_dlssnr.dll (>= 616.56)
  - a D3D12 or D3D11 game that ALREADY uses DLSS. It reads that game's own
    DLSS inputs, so a game without DLSS gives it nothing to read - unless
    the game ships FSR 2/3 or XeSS: upstream OptiScaler hooks those calls
    as its input (its [Inputs] section) and runs DLSS in their place, and
    the fork's pass then sits behind that DLSS. enable_inputs() below sets
    that up; the tool puts a nvngx_dlss.dll beside it, since such a game
    has none.

Two things it does better than the feeder, beyond speed:
  - the pass runs right after the upscaler and BEFORE the interface is drawn,
    so the model never sees the HUD. The feeder processes the HUD along with
    the scene, a known limitation upstream.
  - with frame generation it runs once per RENDERED frame; generated frames
    inherit the result.

Licensing: OptiScaler is GPL-3.0. It is fetched at run time from its own
release page and never bundled here, like every other component.
