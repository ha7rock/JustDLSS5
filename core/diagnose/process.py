r"""What was in the game's process: ours, what was not yet, and whose else.

Two questions a log cannot answer alone. Which of our files the game
really had loaded - read out of the process by core/watch.py - and which
other DLSS hook ReShade loaded into the same session beside ours.

The second one was a warning under a verdict that said "Add-ons loaded,
confirm in the overlay" (#250: DLSS 5 Swapper's overlay beside
neural-upstream, #55 before it). People act on the verdict, not on the
warnings under it, so a second hook in the frame is now said IN it.

Part of core/diagnose; see __init__.py.
