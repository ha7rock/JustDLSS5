r"""What the bridge's own log says about the launch a report reads.

The bridge route was answered "this route logs no frames, so the panel is
the only live picture" in every report it ever sent (#27 #127 #198 #217
#287 #352), while the bridge wrote dlss5-bridge.log beside itself the whole
time: the build, the first frame it delivered, a frame-rate line every 600
frames, and the reason when it turns itself off. Nothing read it.

The file is emptied when the bridge attaches, so it holds one launch - but
not necessarily the launch ReShade.log's last session describes: a launch
in which the bridge did not load leaves the older file behind. It is tied
to ReShade's session by the two logs' own clocks, never by the files'
times.
