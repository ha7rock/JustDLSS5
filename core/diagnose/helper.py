r"""The 64-bit helper a 32-bit game's feed hands its frames to.

On a 32-bit game DLSS does not run in the game at all: dlss5-feed.addon32
ships every frame over a pipe to host64\dlss5-feed-host64.exe, and the
neural add-on and NVIDIA's runtime run in THAT process. So a picture that
freezes while the game's own feed log looks healthy is the helper's story,
and only the helper's log tells it.

#252 (World of Warcraft 3.3.5a, feeder 1.16.0-beta.2): the feed shipped
frames at 135 fps, the helper's Present failed with 0x887A0005 three
seconds after DLSS was created, and its neural add-on never created the
feature. The diagnosis said "Inconclusive", and the report did not even
carry the helper's log. Every phrase read here is in the 1.16.0-beta.2
helper binary; "frame N evaluated" and a clean exit are in the owner's own
working Bayonetta session, which has none of the fault lines.

Part of core/diagnose; see __init__.py.
