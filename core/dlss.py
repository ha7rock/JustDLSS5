"""Does this game ship its own DLSS, and which install path suits it?

This decides between seven ways of getting DLSS 5 neural rendering into a
game. Getting it right matters: the feeder path is always DLAA and needs
motion-vector shaders, whereas a game with its own DLSS can be hooked
directly and keeps its own Quality/Balanced/Performance modes.

    RENODX   ShortFuse's renodx-dlss add-on (the "SF" build). Hooks D3D9,
             D3D11 and D3D12 presentation in-process through a same-adapter
             D3D12 endpoint - no bridge, no synthetic contract, no shaders.
             64-bit only. The add-on the feeder and bridge authors now point
             to for those three APIs.

    NATIVE   the game has DLSS and renders with D3D12.
             Krish's renodx-dlss5 add-on detours the game's own NGX D3D12
             calls. Nothing synthetic, and the game's own quality mode applies.
             The most proven route for D3D12 games that ship DLSS.

    UPSTREAM matiasLombo's neural-upstream add-on. Hooks the same NGX
             EvaluateFeature call but runs the network ITSELF, on the
             render-resolution colour buffer, and hands the result to the
             game's own DLSS as its input. Same-resolution network on a
             smaller image: proportionally cheaper, and the game's quality
             mode still applies. No renodx add-on beside it - two NGX hooks
             fight. Tested on two games by its author.

    OPTI     Dagherbou's OptiScaler fork. Replaces the upscaler and runs the
             model over its output, with a model-resolution dial (25-100%)
             that is the biggest fps lever there is. The author tested RTX 50
             only; with the per-card runtime this tool installs it runs on
             RTX 20/30/40 as well. The game must already use DLSS - or FSR
             2/3 or XeSS: OptiScaler hooks those calls as its INPUT and
             runs DLSS in their place, which is what it is known for.

    BRIDGE   dlss5-bridge: reproduces the DLSS contract on a private D3D12
             session. The route for Vulkan games with DLSS (mirror), and a
             fallback for D3D11.

    FEEDER   DLSS5-Feeder builds a synthetic DLAA contract out of ReShade's
             depth buffer and shader-estimated motion vectors. Works without
             any DLSS in the game, on D3D11/D3D12/Vulkan/OpenGL, and is the
             only way in for 32-bit games (through its host64 helper).

    STANDALONE kibblerz's standalone-dlssnr add-on (DLSS5-Reshade-AIO). Its
             own feed and its own private NGX session - no feeder, no renodx
             add-on. Copies the back buffer at Present, runs the network,
             then DLAA at native resolution or DLSS Super Resolution when the
             game renders below it, frame generation on top, and shows the
             result in a topmost window of its own. Works with or without
             DLSS in the game. Experimental: the window trick is fragile.

    REMIX    the game already has an RTX Remix mod. Remix replaces d3d9.dll
             and path traces the frame in its own runtime (a `.trex` folder),
             and the community forks of that runtime run DLSS-NR inside it,
             after DLSS. No ReShade, no feeder, no add-on - a ReShade proxy
             DLL in the folder crashes a Remix game before it draws.

DirectX 10 is reached by the feeder alone (0.13.1 and later), through a
private D3D11 relay device; nothing else hooks D3D10.
