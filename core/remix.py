r"""What an RTX Remix install looks like, and how DLSS 5 gets into it.

RTX Remix replaces the game's own d3d9.dll with a small bridge; the real
runtime - a 150-230 MB dxvk-remix build - lives in a `.trex` folder (next to
the executable for GTA IV, under `bin\` for Portal RTX). The frame is path
traced by that runtime, then DLSS upscales it, and only then does the DLSS-NR
snippet run. So on this route there is no ReShade, no feeder and no add-on:
the neural pass is a stage inside the Remix runtime itself.

    game D3D9 -> Remix path tracing -> DLSS SR/RR -> DLSS-NR -> tone mapping

NVIDIA's own Remix runtime has no DLSS-NR stage at all. Two community forks
do, and they name their options differently, which is the whole reason this
module exists:

    rtx.neuralUplift.*      Kim2091's gta4-atmos-dlss5 fork, shipped inside
                            xoxor4d's GTA IV RTX mod
    rtx.neuralRendering.*   lunks/dxvk-remix-plus-dlssnr, a drop-in runtime
                            for any Remix game

Guessing which one is installed would silently write a key the runtime never
reads, so the option name is READ OUT OF THE RUNTIME BINARY instead: both
forks embed their own option prefix as a plain string (the RTX_OPTION macro
registers it by name). Verified on this machine: the GTA IV runtime's
`.trex\d3d9.dll` contains "rtx.neuralUplift" and
"rtx.neuralUplift.bypassCallerCheck" and no "rtx.neuralRendering".
