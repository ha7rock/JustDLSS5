"""Spotting anti-cheat before it wastes the user's time - or gets them banned.

ReShade with add-ons injects a DLL and detours graphics entry points. Every
kernel-level anti-cheat treats that as tampering. The result is one of:

  * the game refuses to start
  * ReShade is silently prevented from loading, so nothing happens and the
    user assumes the tool is broken
  * an account ban

Arma 3 and Arma Reforger are the common report: both ship BattlEye, both do
nothing when set up, and neither is a tool bug. Saying so up front is more
useful than letting someone install and wonder.

Detection is by file, not by name list, so it covers games nobody has told us
about.
