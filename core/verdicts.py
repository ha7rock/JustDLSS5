"""Where on the chain a diagnosis verdict stands, and who can act on it.

install -> nothing of ours loaded -> the game refused the hook -> loaded but
the feed never got going -> set up but not switched on -> loaded and we
cannot see -> the add-on crashed -> the model refused -> the driver's
runtime faulted -> working.

One list, read by two things that must never disagree: the corpus tool that
says which kind of failure to fix next (_tools/stuck_games.py), and the
autopilot pass that decides whether another route is worth a try.
The verdicts are matched by their own printed words; a verdict nobody added
here is "unmapped", which the corpus tool reports and the pass treats as "do
not guess".
